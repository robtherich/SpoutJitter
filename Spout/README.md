Max Jitter externals for Spout support on Windows.

"Spout2" is a revision of "Spout" (http://spout.zeal.co/), 
a video frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, which 
allows applications for Microsoft Windows to share OpenGL 
textures in a similar way to Syphon for the Mac.

Spout2 has been completely re-written and supports DirectX 11
textures. The initial release is compatible with existing 
DirectX 9 Spout plugins and applications.

Spout2 includes a developer SDK and sample applications. 
SpoutSDK is preliminary pending testing and is subject to change. 
If you are interested in assisting with development testing,
please contact us on the Spout developer forum :

SpoutSDK is licenced under the Simplified BSD licence.
